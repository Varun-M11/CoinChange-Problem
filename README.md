# CoinChange-Problem ( Python Implementation )

## Objective:
> Given a set of coins and amount, Write an algorithm to find out how many ways we can make the change of the amount using the coins given.

## Example:
```
- Amount = 5

- coins [] = {1,2,3}

- Ways to make change = 5

- {1,1,1,1,1} {1,1,1,2}, {1,2,2}, {1,1,3} {2,3}
```


# Files Description:
- The files *Coin.py* and *CoinChange.py* has the main algorithm to compute the total number of combinations possible (i.e. Total No. of ways to form total) and the files *Minimum.py* and *MinCoinsReq.py* are the application of the algorithm to find out minimum number of coins required to form the amount and also displays which coins are used to form the amount.
